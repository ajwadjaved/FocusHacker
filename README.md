## Project Overview

The Productivity App is built using React and Chakra UI. It consists of two main components:

1. **DialogBox**: This component allows users to enter a task, add a tag, and start a timer. The timer can be paused and continued, and when the task is completed, it will be added to the completed entries list.

2. **CompletedEntries**: This component displays a list of completed tasks. It provides a table view with columns for the task entry, tag, description, and time worked. The entries are displayed in reverse chronological order.

## Features

- Timer: The app includes a timer that tracks the time spent on each task.
- Task Entry: Users can enter their tasks and add optional tags to categorize them.
- Pause and Continue: The timer can be paused and continued as needed.
- Completed Entries List: The app keeps track of completed tasks and displays them in a table format.
